# üì¢ Dear Community Members and Brokers,

We hereby make a formal statement: **As an open and permissionless protocol, CCO does not conduct any vetting or endorsement of listed projects.** This principle aligns with the spirit of other public blockchain protocols such as Uniswap.

### ‚úÖ Core Principle: Permissionless Operation  
CCO is a fully decentralized protocol. **Any project can be freely created, published, and participated in without requiring any approval or review from the platform.**

We firmly believe that **"position consensus" is the most fair and just filter in the Web3 world**.  
Just as Satoshi Nakamoto never reviewed each block nor judged who should be rewarded„ÄÇ  

### <span style="color:red"> **the platform does not assess whether a project is ‚Äúgood or bad,‚Äù ‚Äútrue or false,‚Äù or whether it has ‚Äúpotential.‚Äù**„ÄÇ

Everything operates based on **position proof** ‚Äî that is the true value of the protocol. </span>    
### We collect the following information **solely to help brokers access data more effectively for their own research and consensus judgment** ‚Äî it is **not** for the purpose of review or recommendation.
